Empowering Farmers: Real-Time Coconut Tree Disease Detection and Management Using YOLOv8 and Machine Learning Technique ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ¿
Overview
This project aims to assist farmers by detecting diseases in coconut trees in real-time using advanced computer vision techniques. Powered by the YOLOv8 object detection model and supported by machine learning, the system provides instant feedback along with disease management recommendations to help farmers take immediate action and protect their crops.

Features
ðŸŒŸ Real-time coconut tree disease detection from images or live video

ðŸ§  Highly accurate detection using YOLOv8

ðŸ“Š Confidence scores and disease management suggestions

ðŸ”¥ Visual explanations with EigenCAM for better interpretability

ðŸŽ¯ User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit

ðŸ“ˆ High performance with low false positive and false negative rates

Technologies Used
YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8)

Machine Learning (ML)

Python

Streamlit (for UI)

OpenCV (for video and image handling)

EigenCAM (for model interpretability)

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook (for training)

NVIDIA GPU (for model training acceleration)

Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased coconut trees, covering common diseases such as:

Yellowing Disease

Bud Rot

Leaf Blight

Root Wilt

ðŸ“¦ Note: Dataset link or upload instructions can be provided here.

Results
Achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of over 90%.

False positive and false negative rates were kept minimal.

Real-time detection speed with a frame rate of over 20 FPS on GPU.

Future Work
Extend the system to support multiple crop types.

Integrate drone-based aerial image analysis.

Develop mobile app deployment for field usage.
